## Version 2.9.2 - 2020-01-17

### Fixed

- Linked view entities erroneously inherited their base entities' `.keys` e.g.:
```js
const m = cds.linked(cds.parse(`
  entity Foo { key ID : UUID }
  entity Bar as select from Foo { ID as Kennung };
`))
const { Foo, Bar } = m.entities
Foo.keys //> { ID: string { key: true, type: 'cds.UUID' } }
Bar.keys //> { Kennung: string { key: true, type: 'cds.UUID' } }
// The latter before was erronously:
Bar.keys //> { ID: string { key: true, type: 'cds.UUID' } } -> WRONG
